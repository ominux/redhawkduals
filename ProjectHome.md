The idea is that Altera DE2 boards can be plugged together to create an instance of a battle.  The game master is constant, but the other ships that plug into the game are actual ship controls.  The basic prototype is provided, but the students/competitors are expected to improve on their ship control.

The idea is based around engineers on a StarTrek like ship.
